=============

*Fonts for Professional Typography &mdash; The Non-Cloud Way!*

*TypoPRO* is a carefully hand-selected collection of freely usable
professional fonts for use in Desktop Publishing, on Websites and
especially inside Web-based Desktop or Mobile Applications. Currrently,
*TypoPRO* consists of 131 individual fonts of 15 font families. The
fonts in total span a wide range of font types, font styles and font
weights. This way *TypoPRO* provides a magnitude of typographic
possibilities with just a minimum number of font families.

Collection Features
-------------------

- **Glyph Design**
  All fonts have their glyphs (individual characters) beautifully
  designed and this way provide a really wonderful optical appearance.

- **Font Families**:
  Most of the fonts are based on reasonably large font families of
  individual fonts. This is important, because for professional
  typography results you usually always need multiple weights of at
  least the headline and text fonts.

- **Kerning** & **Hinting**:
  Most of the fonts carry reasonable kerning (instructions for
  character spacing adjustments) and hinting (display instructions for
  rasterization adjustments) information. This is important, because for
  professional typography results this is a must.

- **Liberal Licensing**:
  All fonts are under very liberal Open Source licenses and can be
  freely used even in Closed Source and Commercial contexts.

- **Web Conversion**:
  All fonts are consistently converted from their original TTF/OTF
  format into various font formats for use on the Web. Corresponding
  CSS `@font-face` declaration files were generated, too.
  
- **Font Renaming**:
  To circumvent license restrictions related to font format conversions
  and to avoid confusion with the original font formats, all Web font
  format variants were renamed to consistently carry the "TypoPRO"
  prefix.
  
- **Specimen**:
  For the Web font variants, a specimen in HTML format was generated to
  conveniently preview the font.

Alternatives
------------

Nowadays all those fonts can also be individually
downloaded for free from online font libraries like
[Font Squirrel](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/) or
[DaFont](http://www.dafont.com/) or even on-the-fly used from font
cloud services like [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts) or
[Adobe Typekit](https://typekit.com/). The purpose of TypoPRO is just
different: TypoPRO provides an offline solution and and it intentionally
is an opinionated pre-selection of fonts.

Downloading
-----------

You can conveniently download TypoPRO in various ways:

- Bower: install as client component via the Bower component manager:<br/>
  `$ bower install typopro`

- NPM: install as server component via the Node Package Manager:<br/>
  `$ npm install typopro`

  `$ git clone https://github.com/rse/typopro.git`

  `$ curl -O https://github.com/rse/typopro/archive/master.zip`
