*Fonts for Professional Typography &mdash; The Non-Cloud Way!*

**TypoPRO** is a carefully hand-selected collection of freely usable
professional fonts for use in Desktop Publishing, on Websites and
especially inside Web-based Desktop or Mobile Applications. Currrently,
**TypoPRO** consists of 186 individual fonts of 32 font families. The
fonts in total span a very wide range of font types, font styles, font
weights and font variants. This way **TypoPRO** provides a magnitude of
typographic possibilities with just a minimum number of font families.

Collection Overview
-------------------

#### General Purpose Fonts

The fonts in this group are general purpose ones, i.e., they can be used
equally well for headlines, body text, footnotes, etc. They especially
are part of whole font families and cover a wide range of Unicode
characters.

#### Special Purpose Fonts

The fonts in this group are special purpose ones, i.e., they are usually
used only for particular headlines, subtitles, tags, etc. They are
usually just stand-alone fonts and cover just a very limited set of
Unicode characters.

Collection Features
-------------------

- **Glyph Design**:
  All fonts have their glyphs (individual characters) beautifully
  designed and this way provide a really wonderful optical appearance.

- **Font Families**:
  Most of the fonts are based on reasonably large font families of
  individual fonts. This is important, because for professional
  typography results you usually always need multiple weights of at
  least the headline and text fonts.

- **Kerning** & **Hinting**:
  Most of the fonts carry reasonable kerning (instructions for
  character spacing adjustments) and hinting (display instructions for
  rasterization adjustments) information. This is important, because for
  professional typography results this is a must.

- **Liberal Licensing**:
  All fonts are under very liberal Open Source licenses and can be
  freely used even in Closed Source and Commercial contexts.

- **Web Conversion**:
  All fonts are consistently converted from their original TTF/OTF
  format into various font formats for use on the Web. Corresponding
  CSS `@font-face` declaration files were generated, too.

- **Unicode Character Reduction**
  Some fonts contain a really large number of glyphs, covering a wide
  range of the Unicode character set. This is great in general, but
  dramatically increases the font size, which is a major drawback on the
  web. For this reason, although it reduces the fonts to be used for
  the main Latin based languages (English, German, etc), we reduce the
  fonts in web formats to the smaller Unicode range 0000-00FF (Basic
  Latin, Latin-1 Supplement). The DTP formats of all fonts we reduce
  to the larger (but still reduced for some very large fonts) Unicode
  range set 0000-036F,1DC0-1EFF,2000-20FF,2150-218F,2C60-2C7F,A720-A7FF
  (Basic Latin, Latin-1 Supplement, Latin Extended-A, Latin Extended-B,
  IPA Extensions, Spacing Modifier Letters, Combining Diacriticals
  Marks, Combining Diacritical Marks Supplement, Latin Extended
  Additional, General Punctuation. Superscripts and Subscripts, Currency
  Symbols, Combining Diacritical Marks for Symbols, Number Forms, Latin
  Extended-C, Latin Extended-D)

- **Font Renaming**:
  To circumvent license restrictions related to font format conversions
  and to avoid confusion with the original font formats, all Web font
  format variants were renamed to consistently carry the "TypoPRO"
  prefix.

- **Font Parameters**:
  All font families consistently use a common font family name (CSS
  `font-family` attribute) and all fonts within the same font family
  are consistently distinguished via CSS parameters `font-weight`,
  `font-style`, `font-stretch` and `font-variant`.

- **Specimen**:
  For the Web font variants, a specimen in HTML format was generated to
  conveniently preview the font.

Alternatives
------------

Nowadays all those fonts can also be individually
downloaded for free from online font libraries like
[Font Squirrel](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/) or
[DaFont](http://www.dafont.com/) or even on-the-fly used from font
cloud services like [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts),
[Open Font Library](http://openfontlibrary.org/) or
[Adobe Typekit](https://typekit.com/). The purpose of **TypoPRO** is just
different: it provides an offline solution and it intentionally
is a very opinionated pre-selection of reasonable fonts.

Downloading
-----------

You can conveniently download TypoPRO in various ways:

- Bower: install as client component via the Bower component manager:<br/>
  `$ bower install typopro`

- NPM: install as server component via the Node Package Manager:<br/>
  `$ npm install typopro`

- Git: directly clone the official repository:<br/>
  `$ git clone https://github.com/rse/typopro.git`

- cURL: download only the main file from the repository:<br/>
  `$ curl -O https://github.com/rse/typopro/archive/master.zip`

Content
-------

In directory `dtp/` (Desktop Publishing) all font sources, one directory
per font family, are stored in OpenType Font (OTF) or TrueType Font
(TTF) format. In directory `web/` (World Wide Web) the same fonts are
stored, but this time in Web formats: Embedded OpenType (EOT), Web Open
Font Format (WOFF), TrueType Font (TTF) and Compressed Scalable Vector
Graphics (SVGZ). The different formats for each font are required for
maximum portability across browsers and operating systems.

Recommendation
--------------

For general purpose typography, I can recommend you all of the above 17
General Purpose fonts, of course. But my personal preference most of
the times is towards *Open Sans* for headlines, *Droid Serif* for body
text and *DejaVu Sans Mono* for code. There are many reasons for this,
but mainly all those three, each in their class, in my humble opinion,
provide the best balance of legibility (because of very distinct
glyph outlines), beauty (because of very harmonic glyph curves) and
versatility (because of their different available stroke widths and
optional italic variants). My second choice would be *Source Sans Pro*
for headlines, *Neuton* for body text and *Anonymous Pro* for code.

Rebuilding
----------

In order to rebuild the `web/` content from the `dtp/` content,
you can use the `etc/convert.sh` script. It needs Ralf S. Engelschall's **fontface**
frontend program, as provided by the [OpenPKG](http://www.openpkg.org/) package `fontface`,
and a magnitude of backend programs for font conversion: [FontForge](http://fontforge.org/),
[font-optimizer](http://bitbucket.org/philip/font-optimizer/), [ttf2eot](http://ttf2eot.googlecode.com/).
On installing the OpenPKG `fontface` package, these dependencies are all installed automatically, too.

Licensing
---------

All included font families are distributed under very liberal Open Source licenses.
For license details on each individual font family, please see the files
`dtp/*/license.txt` and the meta information in the files `dtp/*/blurb.txt`.
